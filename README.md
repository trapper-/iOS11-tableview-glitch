# iOS11-tableview-glitch

Test with iPhone. 

Tapping on a cell reloads that cell.

You will see the correct behaviour for the first 20 so rows, the cell fades in after the reload.

Scroll down to rows 20+ click to reload a few cells.

You will see all kinds of weird behaviour with cells jumping around and scrolling strangely.
